#TODO:

## CSS

- fix the game-mode DIVs to be centered
- Issue when clicking X without choosing where to navigate. on the big screen there are no menu elements
- Need to fix the bottom value, currently is fixed, or make it to 0 (NAV when open)
- BTN Add effects on hover
- Make a different cursor (?)

#HELPERS:

- If on the load there are variables which are not in current index page
  use below to do something with that variable if it's in the specific page

<pre> ```js 
const aboutContainer = document.querySelector(".about"); 
if (aboutContainer) { 
    do something 
} 
``` </pre>
